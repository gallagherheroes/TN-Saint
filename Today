interesting discussion today...bifurcated brain...price of gain v. information overload...multi-tasking a necessity in the future? Once best, now absolete? Is the dumbest generation a valid assertion?

Cohen and Rosenzweig challenges us to consider digital media/history in profound terms. The pros...the ability to very quickly make and test out intellectual connections; con...current open access will likely alter historical research and writing in ways we haven't imagined, thus a clear red flag; pro...small populations [and by extention, disadvantaged souls]can keep up; (think of grandma and the remote); pro...we historians can speak to and exchange ideas, thoughts and scholarship to vastly more people without significant economic cost which allows us to compare, contrast and even enhance our work in ways our mentors never could have imagined.

Certainly we must consider this a paradigm shift in our thought processes. We are challenged to balance convention against this new frontier. In doing so we must come to terms with problems of quality, authenticity, authority and durability.

Will our generation of historians take up the mantle of 'free' access and how will we police our profession?
