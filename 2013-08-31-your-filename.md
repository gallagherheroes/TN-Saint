Reviewing McCluhan: If It Works Its Obsolete (1) 

One of the most charismatic, controversial and original thinkers of our time whose remarkable perception propelled him onto the international stage, Marshall McLuhan is universally regarded as the father of communications and media studies and prophet of the information age.

 McCluhan is probably best known for coining the term "Global Village" and such catch phrases as such catch phrases as "The media is the message". McLuhan originated he idea that human beings can extend their nervous system via a global neural net through the use of electronic media and devices, and he described many of the changes that could be wrought by such a network,him the title "Patron Saint of Wired Magazine".

McCluhan emphasized the way in which media molds our psyches to interact with the environment and with each other. Note that for McLuhan "media" did not merely include printed matter or electronic media or even artwork, but also tools and artifacts. ("We shape our tools and they in turn shape us.")

In Understanding The Media (1964) he further expands his pivotal theory which stated that the ways in which we are affected by the media itself is more significant that the content which the media carries.

That is, how are ways of looking at ourselves and our world is shaped not just by ideas, but by the way we are habituated to perceive. According to McLuhan's theory, technologies alter the manner in which we habitually process information, inclining us more toward some learning styles than others (depending on the technology). Thus print encourages us to become visual and linear in our thinking. By contrast, music is auditory, spatial, and even kinesthetic. Cultures which pass their knowledge through storytelling encourage auditory learning which, in the era before audio tapes and radio, required the transmission of knowledge to be a social event (even if limited to two).

 McLuhan’s in essence issued a radical call to re-evaluate the mental conditioning imposed on us by our technology and media. To them it seemed to go hand in hand with Timothy Leary's 1960's mandate to "Turn on, tune in, drop out."
 
McCluhan attempts to postsulates what the "4 Laws of Media" are: every technology (1) amplifies part of our culture, (2) obsolesces aspects previously amplified, (3) retrieves elements previously obsolesced, and (4) eventually reverses or "flips" into something else entirely.

McCluhan prophesied that printed books would become obsolete, killed off by television and by other electronic information technology. In The Gutenberg Galaxy McLuhan had stated, "Print is the technology of individualism." In War and Peace in the Global Village, he predicted that the newly emerging electronic network (i.e. extended neural net) would recreate "the world in the image of a global village", in which people understood instantly the impact of their actions and shared knowledge about possible solutions.

 McCluhan also predicted that technology "eventually reverses or flips into something else entirely". What exactly this means for the Web, if true, remains to be seen. However one of the main challenges it already faces is keeping desired information accessible as the total quantity of information available increases almost exponentially.

Finally I include some of his popular qutations for insightful relection of his work and for eaxch of to consider the effects of digital media upon our profession as historians:
